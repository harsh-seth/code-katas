## Question
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

## Notes
Approach 1
- Using two pointers, approach each other. Stop when a vowel is reached. Swap when both pointers are stopped. Exit when both pointers overlap.
